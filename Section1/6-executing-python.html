<p>So far we have just used a Python interpreter, but Python is more traditionally a scripting language. That is, it excels at short programs that help with certain tasks or problems. We are going to write a short program that solves the Pythagorean Theorem: <code>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</code>. Solving for the hypotenuse of a right triangle is a surprisingly good example for us. It is straightforward, often too difficult to do manually, and extremely useful in computer science. The Pythagorean Theorem comes up in graphics, physics, game logic, AI, and more.</p>
<p>A brief overview of the equation will help us determine how to structure our program:</p>
<pre><code>  |\
  | \ c
a |  \
  |___\
    b</code></pre>
<p>Working from my stunning graphic, we have the two sides, of length <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, as well as a hypotenuse of size <code>c</code>. We really want to find <code>c</code> and not <code>c^2</code>, so let’s rearrange the equation a little bit: <code>sqrt(a*a + b*b) = c</code>. If we flip the sides (<code>c = sqrt(a*a + b*b)</code>), we have something awfully similar to a variable assignment.</p>
<p>Thinking back to our circumference example, our variables fall into two groups: those we are given (often called parameters or arguments), and those we want to find. In this case, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are going to be our arguments, and <code>c</code> our return value. Now that we know where everything goes, our function mostly just falls into place.</p>
<p>Using our knowledge of Vim, we can write and save a function in a file. After that, we will be able to use it whenever we want without writing it again. If you haven’t already, now would be a good time to start setting up a directory to use for work. I like <code>~/Projects</code>, but it is completely up to you. In the future I won’t explicitly tell you what to do with your files, but:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="bu">cd</span>
$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> Projects
$ <span class="bu">cd</span> Projects
$ <span class="fu">mkdir</span> Python
$ <span class="bu">cd</span> Python
$ <span class="fu">touch</span> pyt.py
$ <span class="ex">vim</span> pyt.py</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have a file, <code>pyt.py</code>, to work in and a way to edit it, Vim. So let’s write our function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> pythagorean_theorem(a, b):
    c <span class="op">=</span> sqrt(a<span class="op">*</span>a <span class="op">+</span> b<span class="op">*</span>b)
    <span class="cf">return</span> c</code></pre></div>
<p>This looks good, except for one slight problem. The function <code>sqrt()</code> is not actually available to us. Most programming languages have it, but not always immediately accessible. Languages often come with “standard libraries”, which are essentially big collections of functions that you will probably need at some point. We need to ask Python to go get some of that code for us because <code>sqrt()</code> is there. To do that we only have to make a small addition to our program.</p>
<h2 id="importing">Importing</h2>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="im">import</span> math

<span class="kw">def</span> pythagorean_theorem(a, b):
    c <span class="op">=</span> math.sqrt(a<span class="op">*</span>a <span class="op">+</span> b<span class="op">*</span>b)
    <span class="cf">return</span> c</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>import math</code> statement at the top of the file tells Python that we would like to use functions from the math library. When we then use those functions, we add <code>math.</code> to the beginning to specify where it comes from. This is, in part, to make sure that there aren’t name collisions. If we had defined a function called <code>sqrt()</code>, it would no longer be clear what we were referring to. Do we mean the one we wrote? Or do we mean the one from <code>math</code>? Using <code>math.</code> makes it perfectly clear what we intend.</p>
<p>We can now save and quit. (You could even do a <code>cat pyt.py</code> to make sure everything is still there.) Our program doesn’t tell Python to do anything, it just defines a new function that we <em>could</em> use if we wanted to. So asking Python to run it wouldn’t be productive at this point. But it would be nice if we could play around with our new function a little bit. So let’s open up the REPL with <code>python</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> pyt
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pyt.pythagorean_theorem(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>)
<span class="fl">5.0</span>
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pyt.pythagorean_theorem(<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">12</span>)
<span class="fl">13.0</span>
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pyt.pythagorean_theorem(<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">13</span>)
<span class="fl">13.92838827718412</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>import pyt</code> works exactly like <code>import math</code>. This time though, Python found pyt from the file <code>pyt.py</code> instead of from the libraries it comes with. And again, we add <code>pyt.</code> to the beginning of our function calls. After a few tests, it seems our function works correctly! We can double check our answers with a calculator or by hand if you are a very brave soul.</p>
<p>Let’s make one more change to our program. So far it just has some definitions, but we want to make it do actual work.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="im">import</span> math

<span class="kw">def</span> pythagorean_theorem(a, b):
    c <span class="op">=</span> math.sqrt(a<span class="op">*</span>a <span class="op">+</span> b<span class="op">*</span>b)
    <span class="cf">return</span> c

x <span class="op">=</span> pythagorean_theorem(<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">13</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>And again into the REPL,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> pyt
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pyt.pythagorean_theorem(<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">13</span>)
<span class="fl">13.92838827718412</span>
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pyt.x
<span class="fl">13.92838827718412</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’ve successfully made Python find the hypotenuse of a triangle all by itself. Unfortunately, we need one more piece before our script is really useful. Right now it calculates the answer, but doesn’t do anything with it. Next time, we are going to learn how to talk to Python and make it talk back.</p>
