<p>First off, welcome! For whatever amount of time you decide to spend here, I hope you find the experience enjoyable and fruitful.</p>
<p>This site is intended to provide two things. First, a thorough introduction to all fundamental concepts in computer science. Second, the resources to get started in any particular field you wish.</p>
<p>I would like to be clear that this is not a programming tutorial. My goal is to teach you how computers work. Programming is just a way of using your knowledge about computers to make them do something. When you look at programs and programming languages as answers to real problems, the solutions make much more sense. In fact, many times, you could have come up with these ideas yourself.</p>
<p>I also want this content to be accessible to everyone. Programming is a lot like language; there are 100 different ways to write. With language, you can write novels, research papers, poetry, texts, tweets, songs, etc., all of which require different skills and do different things. Some programs are large, business oriented monsters, while others are short and do specific little things. You can create games for phones or control the boosters on space shuttles. You can generate images by manually changing each pixel or you can teach a machine how to 3d print an object. Even the smallest programs that find the area of a square or tally up a receipt are useful. Everyone can make something.</p>
