<h1 id="strings">Strings</h1>
<p>C does not have a special <code>string</code> type. Instead, it just uses a list of <code>char</code>’s. However, C provides a number of functions and features that make working with strings easier. String are central to many aspects of programming, so it’s important to get to know them (and their pitfalls).</p>
<p><code>printf</code> uses one of these features. Using the tools from last time, let’s create a string:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">char</span> my_string[] = <span class="st">&quot;Hello&quot;</span>;

printf(<span class="st">&quot;my_string contains the string: %s</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, my_string);</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a little different than what we have seen. First, we didn’t give a number for the initial size of the array. Because we gave a value for the array immediately, the compiler can figure out how big the array should be. Second, we initialized the array with a string literal (i.e. some characters between quotes), instead of the <code>{}</code> notation we learned last time. This is part of the machinery to make strings a little easier. When we get a bit farther, we can dig into why this trick works.</p>
<p>If we supply the <code>include</code> and <code>main</code> boilerplate code, our output looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">my_string</span> contains the string: Hello</code></pre></div>
<p>Imagine for a moment what <code>my_string</code> looks like in memory:</p>
<pre><code>                   my_string
+========+========+========+========+========+
|  &#39;H&#39;   |   &#39;e&#39;  |   &#39;l&#39;  |   &#39;l&#39;  |   &#39;o&#39;  |
+========+========+========+========+========+</code></pre>
<p>Here, I’ve used our shorten form from before, so each box represents a <code>char</code>, 8 bits, or 1 byte (all the same). I’ve also filled in the values. Now imagine we are writing the code for <code>printf</code>. We are given the array of <code>char</code>’s called <code>my_string</code>, and we are asked to print out all the values in it. How do we do it?</p>
<p>If we were asked to print a single character, it would be easy because we know that a <code>char</code> is always 1 byte. But arrays can be any size! If you’ve thought a bit about compilers, you might say that the compiler should be able to know how long the array is. There’s a sticking point though: we are not required to actually use all the space we ask for.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a variable called <code>my_name</code> that will hold a user’s name. This will be a string, but how big? My first name requires seven letters. But someone named Alice would only need 5. Instead of trying to fit these names perfectly, we can just declare:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">char</span> my_name[<span class="dv">50</span>];</code></pre></div>
<p>That way we set aside enough space to hold any name. But we won’t always use the entire space. And when we call <code>printf</code> on <code>my_name</code>, we want it to print out just my name without any of the extra garbage that is in the array after it.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, it turns out that 50 probably isn’t enough to hold even just first names. Many large companies have written about how hard it is to deal with names from around the world. Properly handling every name is not an easy task!)</p>
<h2 id="null-terminated-strings">Null-terminated Strings</h2>
<p>To handle this, we set up a conventional rule. We promise to always signal the end of our data with a null byte, a byte composed of all zeros. So our picture from before is actually incorrect. Our <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code> actually looks like this in memory.</p>
<pre><code>                   my_string
+========+========+========+========+========+========+
|  &#39;H&#39;   |   &#39;e&#39;  |   &#39;l&#39;  |   &#39;l&#39;  |   &#39;o&#39;  |  &#39;\0&#39;  |
+========+========+========+========+========+========+</code></pre>
<p>Just like <code>\n</code>, <code>\0</code> is a special character. It means the byte composed entirely of zeros. The slash is important. If we didn’t have it, we would never be able to print the character 0. To maybe make this clearer:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">char</span> zero_string[] = <span class="st">&quot;After 0, things print, but after \0 not&quot;</span>;
printf(<span class="st">&quot;%s</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, zero_string);</code></pre></div>
<p>Running this, we see:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">After</span> 0, things print, but after </code></pre></div>
<p>The end of our string is cut off. C saw our null character and treated it as the end of the string. Our string is just an array, so let’s try to read the value at the end. Remembering how array access works from last time, we want the sixth character, so we use <code>my_string[6-1]</code> to access it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">printf(<span class="st">&quot;The final byte is %d!</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, my_string[<span class="dv">5</span>]);</code></pre></div>
<p>Now I cheated a little bit here. I used <code>%d</code> even though I wanted to print out a <code>char</code>. The issue is that <code>%c</code> doesn’t print anything when it is given a null byte. When we read that block as an <code>int</code> using <code>%d</code>, we see that the byte is in fact all 0’s. Try with <code>%c</code> to see what happens.</p>
<p>Strings are a tricky part of C. They are the source of many <em>huge</em> security issues. However, knowing how and why everything works is the best way I know of avoiding these traps. Whenever you have an issue with strings, you should ask yourself if you are holding up your end of the bargain. Do all of your strings end with <code>\0</code>? Does your string have a null byte earlier than it should? Sometimes the compiler knows where to put them to help you, but you should always think about your ending null bytes when working in C.</p>
