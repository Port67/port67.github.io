<h1 id="types-in-c">Types in C</h1>
<p>After last time, I hope that you are starting to get a feel for what types are. They are a set of rules for interpreting the raw binary data as something else. I am now going to present some of the standard types of C, and talk about their rules.</p>
<p>The <code>printf</code> function will help us do some interesting things here. <code>printf</code> is used to print and format strings. Formatting gives us the ability to insert the value of variables into the string, but types play a role in how they are printed. In general, <code>printf</code> can be given a string with a number of format specifiers, and a variable for every format specifier. For example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> x = <span class="dv">0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The value of x is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Within the quotes, we have our string argument. The format specifier is <code>%d</code> which prints the variable as if it is an integer. As I introduce each type, I’ll also show how to print it. At the end, we will try printing with the wrong type to see what will happen.</p>
<p>We will also use <code>sizeof</code> to check how many bytes these types actually use. When C was first developed, computers could hold much less data than they can now. As a consequence, the C standard only sets minimum guidelines for how big different types should be. Specific examples below should help.</p>
<h2 id="char">char</h2>
<p>A <code>char</code> is a single byte encoded using ASCII. To set a <code>char</code>, it is best to use a single character with single quotes <code>'a'</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">char</span> x = &#39;a&#39;;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The value of x is: %c</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
}</code></pre></div>
<p>As we can see, a <code>char</code> just uses a single byte of space. This means it can represent 256 different values.</p>
<h2 id="unsigned">unsigned</h2>
<p><code>unsigned</code> is the standard decimal translation we have been using.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">unsigned</span> x = <span class="dv">0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The value of x is: %u</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Here people’s results may be different. The C standard promises that an <code>unsigned int</code> (or equivalently <code>unsigned</code>) is at least 2 bytes. In the earliest stages of C, computers could only handle 16 bits of information at the same time. If we divide by 8 bits because there are 8 bits in a byte, we will see that this is 2 bytes. So some of you will have 2 byte <code>unsigned</code>’s that represent the range 0 - 65536.</p>
<p>Figuring out ranges is usually pretty easy. In decimal, we know that the biggest 4 digit number is 9999, and when we add 1, we get 10000. It’s the same in binary. The biggest 8 bit number is <code>1111 1111</code> and when we add 1 we get <code>1 0000 0000</code>. Remembering how we translate to decimal, this is just 2^8 = 256. Subtracting 1, we know the biggest 8 bit number is 255. Likewise, the biggest 16 bit or 2 byte number is 2^16 - 1 = 65535</p>
<p>Since the invention of 32-bit and more commonly know 64-bit computers, <code>unsigned</code>’s are more often 4 bytes in size. This makes their range of values 0 - 4,294,967,295 (or 2^(32) - 1). Even though 64-bit would allow for 8 bytes (8 bits * 8 bytes = 64 bits) C just stuck to 4.</p>
<h2 id="int">int</h2>
<p><code>int</code>’s are the signed version of <code>unsigned int</code>’s. This is how we represent negative numbers. The size is the same, and the range just shifts halfway into the negatives, -32,768 - 32,767 for 2 byte <code>int</code>’s or -2,147,483,648 - 2,147,483,647 for 4 bytes.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">int</span> x = <span class="dv">0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The value of x is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
}</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="float">float</h2>
<p>Floating point numbers are numbers that look like <code>1234.52</code> or <code>-4.234234234</code> or <code>1234901234.515156114</code>. These numbers are meant to represent the rational numbers (often written as fractions). However, one difficult property of the rational numbers is that given any two, there are an infinite number of rationals between them. If you give me <code>0.3</code> and 0.4<code>, I can start by listing</code>0.31<code>, 0.311</code>, <code>0.3111</code>, and keep going forever. Floating point numbers have a lot to cover!</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">float</span> x = <span class="dv">0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The value of x is: %f</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Working with a byte again for simplicity, floating point numbers have 3 parts: a sign bit, an group of exponent bits, and a group of fraction bits. The number of bits in the exponent and fraction depends on the implementation. In real <code>float</code>’s, there are 8 exponent bits and 23 fraction bits. Let’s say for our purpose that there are 4 exponent bits and 3 fraction bits.</p>
<pre><code>            1101 0110
sign: 1     exponent: 1010      fraction: 110
        sign * fraction^exponent
        -1   * 110 e (1010)
        -1   * 6  * 10^(-6)
            -0.000006</code></pre>
<p>It’s not essential that you know exactly how floating point works, but it is a pretty amazing idea. In practice, you typically won’t have to worry about implementation details of this or other types. However, it is good to know, and if you continue deeper into computer science, you will likely need the knowledge at some point.</p>
<h2 id="printf-fun">Printf Fun</h2>
<p>I promised we would mess with some wrong types, so here we go. Let’s think about this piece of code,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">float</span> x = <span class="fl">97.0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The (float) value of x is: %f</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
}</code></pre></div>
<p>To us, the conversion to an <code>int</code> is clear, just drop the numbers after the decimal. Let’s try just telling <code>printf</code> to print <code>x</code> as if it were an <code>int</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">float</span> x = <span class="fl">97.0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The (float) value of x is: %f</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The (int) value of x is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
}</code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">gcc</span> types.c
$ <span class="ex">./a.out</span>
<span class="ex">x</span> takes up 4 byte(s)
<span class="ex">The</span> (float) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 97.000000
<span class="ex">The</span> (int) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 1720696848</code></pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, that did not go as we hoped. The issue is that we told <code>printf</code> we were going to give it an <code>int</code>, but we gave it a <code>float</code> instead. Now, we can give it <code>x</code> as an <code>int</code>, we just have to specify it. The way I wrote the <code>printf</code> output actually hints at how we do it.</p>
<p>In C we can “cast” types. To “cast” <code>x</code> as an <code>int</code>, we do this: <code>(int) x</code>. This tells C that it needs to read <code>x</code> as if it were an <code>int</code> instead of whatever it is. Let’s try properly casting <code>x</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">float</span> x = <span class="fl">97.0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The (float) value of x is: %f</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The (int) value of x is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The casted (int) value of x is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, (<span class="dt">int</span>) x);
}</code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">gcc</span> types.c
$ <span class="ex">./a.out</span>
<span class="ex">x</span> takes up 4 byte(s)
<span class="ex">The</span> (float) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 97.000000
<span class="ex">The</span> (int) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 1720696848
<span class="ex">The</span> casted (int) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 97</code></pre></div>
<p>Great! I want to point out that we didn’t change <code>x</code> at all. Casts only change the way the value is read in that exact place. If we use <code>x</code> again it will still be a float.</p>
<p>How about <code>char</code>?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {
    <span class="dt">float</span> x = <span class="fl">97.0</span>;
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;x takes up %d byte(s)</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(x));
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The (float) value of x is: %f</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The (int) value of x is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The casted (int) value of x is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, (<span class="dt">int</span>) x);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;The casted (char) value of x is: %c</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, (<span class="dt">char</span>) x);
}</code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">gcc</span> types.c
$ <span class="ex">./a.out</span>
<span class="ex">x</span> takes up 4 byte(s)
<span class="ex">The</span> (float) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 97.000000
<span class="ex">The</span> (int) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 1720696848
<span class="ex">The</span> casted (int) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: 97
<span class="ex">The</span> casted (char) <span class="ex">value</span> of x is: a</code></pre></div>
<p>As we (maybe) expected, ASCII maps the byte <code>0110 0001</code> to <code>a</code>, so the output is <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>I want to end on a word of warning. As I promised, C gives us all kinds of power. However, I hope you can get a glimpse of how wrong this all can go. Type casting is dangerous business. But, it is a tool that you will have to use and it is best that you have some idea of how it works. Programming is all about choosing the best tool for the job, so you need to know about everything you have access to.</p>
