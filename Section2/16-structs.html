<h1 id="data-structures">Data Structures</h1>
<p>One of the main jobs of programs and programming languages is to represent data. We’ve worked with many small representations through types. Each type tells us how to interpret a few bytes as numbers or letters or strings. But it’s time to start thinking bigger. We want to be able to work with data that represents books, people, cars, cities, planes, or anything you can think of.</p>
<p>As we talked about before, modern computers, phones, and even coffee-makers handle enormous numbers of bytes regularly. It would be pretty difficult to make all that work correctly if all we had were <code>int</code>’s and <code>char</code>’s. So we need a new way to add structure to our data that gives it some extra meaning.</p>
<p>In C, the <code>struct</code> keyword lets us create “data structures”, types composed of smaller types that represent something new. We have almost all of the ideas that we need to understand structs, so let’s look at an example.</p>
<p>Many old arcade games had a high score list so that you could have a score to aim for. Getting your name on the top 5 or 10 list would mean that everyone who played the game could see how good you are. We will be storing and working with these high scores, so let’s create a new <code>struct</code> that holds them.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> HighScore {
    <span class="dt">char</span> initials[<span class="dv">4</span>]; <span class="co">// 3 initial ID, like AAA</span>
    <span class="dt">int</span> score;        <span class="co">// The high score</span>
};</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a simple struct, but it helps us with a couple things. First, we can return this struct from functions. If we didn’t have this, we wouldn’t be able to return both the initials and the score. You can only return one value in C. But with our <code>HighScore</code> struct, we can return both at the same time.</p>
<p>Second, we can make our code clearer. Consider two declarations of the same function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">char</span> *better_score(<span class="dt">int</span> score1, <span class="dt">char</span> *inits1, <span class="dt">int</span> score2, <span class="dt">char</span> *inits2);
<span class="dt">char</span> *better_score(HighScore hs1, HighScore hs2);</code></pre></div>
<p>Reading these declarations, what would you guess these functions do? The first one is a little confusing, but there are scores and initials that go together somehow. The second one is not perfect, but it is a little better. We know that this function takes two <code>HighScore</code> structs, and returns some string. If we look at the <code>HighScore</code> struct, we might guess that this function returns the initials of the better score.</p>
<p>This is not a rule that structs are always better, but it does give some support to that idea. One final consideration is if we wanted to add another field to the struct. Imagine we wanted to add a time, then our functions would look like,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">char</span> *better_score(<span class="dt">int</span> score1, <span class="dt">char</span> *inits1, <span class="dt">int</span> time1,
                   <span class="dt">int</span> score2, <span class="dt">char</span> *inits2, <span class="dt">int</span> time2);
<span class="dt">char</span> *better_score(HighScore hs1, HighScore hs2);</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, it fills up space quickly.</p>
<h2 id="using-structs">Using Structs</h2>
<p>Enough talk, let’s use them,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="kw">struct</span> HighScore {
    <span class="dt">char</span> initials[<span class="dv">4</span>];
    <span class="dt">int</span> score;
};

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {

    <span class="co">// Declare hs as a variable of type `struct HighScore`</span>
    <span class="kw">struct</span> HighScore hs;

    <span class="co">// Initialize the initials field of hs</span>
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">0</span>] = &#39;A&#39;;
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">1</span>] = &#39;A&#39;;
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">2</span>] = &#39;A&#39;;
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">3</span>] = &#39;\<span class="dv">0</span>&#39;;

    <span class="co">// Initialize the score field of hs</span>
    hs.score = <span class="dv">0</span>;

    <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span>;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>First, we declare our variable <code>hs</code>. It has type <code>struct HighScore</code>. We need to tell C that <code>HighScore</code> is a struct, so it can find it. Next, we access the fields of the struct with <code>.</code>. The syntax is <code>variable_name.field_name</code>. Here we set the value of the field, but we can also access the value the same way,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="pp">#include </span><span class="im">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="kw">struct</span> HighScore {
    <span class="dt">char</span> initials[<span class="dv">4</span>];
    <span class="dt">int</span> score;
};

<span class="dt">int</span> main(<span class="dt">int</span> argc, <span class="dt">char</span> **argv) {

    <span class="co">// Declare hs as a variable of type `struct HighScore`</span>
    <span class="kw">struct</span> HighScore hs;

    <span class="co">// Initialize the initials field of hs</span>
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">0</span>] = &#39;A&#39;;
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">1</span>] = &#39;A&#39;;
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">2</span>] = &#39;A&#39;;
    hs.initials[<span class="dv">3</span>] = &#39;\<span class="dv">0</span>&#39;;

    <span class="co">// Initialize the score field of hs</span>
    hs.score = <span class="dv">0</span>;

    printf(<span class="st">&quot;initials are: %s</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, hs.initials);
    printf(<span class="st">&quot;score is: %d</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, hs.score);

    <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="dv">0</span>;
}</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="struct-internals">Struct Internals</h2>
<p><code>hs</code> is just like any other variable. We can pass it to functions, we can get a pointer to it, and we can change it’s value. But we don’t know how the type is stored in memory or how it is interpreted. Luckily, we have all the pieces to understand it, so lets take a look.</p>
<pre><code>               struct HighScore
       +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
       | int |char |char |char |char |
       +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
bytes:    4     1     1     1     1    =     8</code></pre>
<p>Our struct contains 8 bytes of data. If we ask C how big it is with,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c">printf(<span class="st">&quot;Size of HighScore is: %zu</span><span class="sc">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">sizeof</span>(HighScore));</code></pre></div>
<p>We will see that C thinks it is 8 bytes too. What if our initials only had two characters though? We can check this by just changing the field declaration,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">char</span> initials[<span class="dv">3</span>];</code></pre></div>
<p>Now if we run exactly the same code, we get output of… 8. But why? Our struct should look like this in memory,</p>
<pre><code>           struct HighScore
       +=====+=====+=====+=====+
       | int |char |char |char |
       +=====+=====+=====+=====+
bytes:    4     1     1     1    =   7</code></pre>
<p>There are only seven bytes of data, so why does our struct use eight? There is an idea called “alignment” that is causing this. It is easiest for the computer if it can access multi-byte values (like <code>int</code>’s) at multiples of their size. Since our <code>int</code> is four bytes, it should start at address 0,4,8,12,16 … and so on. If we had a pair of our structs in an array, they would line up like this,</p>
<pre><code>        struct HighScore        struct HighScore
    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
    | int |char |char |char | int |char |char |char |
    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
bytes: 4     1     1     1     4     1     1     1
addr:  0     4     5     6     7     11    12    13</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, 7 is not a multiple of 4, so this won’t work. We have to “pad” the struct to fill out to a multiple of 8. In this case, we just have to include and extra byte of all 0’s. With the padding, our pair looks like this.</p>
<pre><code>           struct HighScore       |      struct HighScore       |
    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
    | int |char |char |char |  0  | int |char |char |char |  0  |
    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
bytes: 4     1     1     1     1     4     1     1     1     1
addr:  0     4     5     6     7     8     12    13    14    15</code></pre>
<p>Now things line up properly, but we do waste 2 bytes. Ordering structures to pack them as tightly as possible is usually not very important, but it is good to know. For example, look at what happens with this small change,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> HighScore {
    <span class="dt">char</span> first;  <span class="co">// First initial</span>
    <span class="dt">int</span> score;   <span class="co">// the high score</span>
    <span class="dt">char</span> middle; <span class="co">// The middle initial</span>
    <span class="dt">char</span> last;   <span class="co">// The final initial</span>
}</code></pre></div>
<p>How many bytes will this struct require? We still only have 7 bytes of data. But since we have to line up the <code>int</code> after we already put one <code>char</code>, this structure takes up twelve bytes.</p>
<pre><code>                           struct HighScore
       +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
       |char |  0  |  0  |  0  | int |char |char |  0  |  0  |
       +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
bytes:    1     1     1     1     4     1     1     1     1   =  12
total:    0     1     2     3     4     8     9     10    11</code></pre>
<p>Just by moving one little <code>char</code>, we now have five wasted bytes instead of 1. If you start working with big data, this can add up!</p>
<p>We can also now understand how the <code>.</code> operator works. Just like arrays, it works with offsets from the start. The only difference is that arrays can do <code>x * sizeof(type)</code> while structs have to match up the field names with their proper offset. For this struct,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="kw">struct</span> HighScore {
    <span class="dt">int</span> score;
    <span class="dt">char</span> initials[];
}</code></pre></div>
<p>We can calculate the offsets at compile time.</p>
<pre><code>hs.score
hs + offset(score)
hs + 0
hs</code></pre>
<p>and for the initials</p>
<pre><code>hs.initials
hs + offset(initials)
hs + 4</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>.</code> is just simple addition to find the field in memory.</p>
